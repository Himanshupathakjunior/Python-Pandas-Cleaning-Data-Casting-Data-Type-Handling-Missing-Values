Data scientists spend a large amount of their time cleaning datasets and getting them down to a form with which they can work. In fact, a lot of data scientists argue that the initial steps of obtaining and cleaning data constitute 80% of the job.

Therefore, if you are just stepping into this field or planning to step into this field, it is important to be able to deal with messy data, whether that means missing values, inconsistent formatting, malformed records, or nonsensical outliers.

In this code, we’ll leverage Python’s Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean data.

We’ll cover the following:

Dropping unnecessary columns in a DataFrame
Changing the index of a DataFrame
Using .str() methods to clean columns
Using the DataFrame.applymap() function to clean the entire dataset, element-wise
Renaming columns to a more recognizable set of labels
Skipping unnecessary rows in a CSV file![Screenshot (36)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114003984/192477189-dfcc5246-5e57-4ac0-bfe5-7fc9f00bd2fd.png)
